* Hello.

This is an experiment on translating the python library witchcraft to go.

At the moment it is around 4 times *faster*, in insertions, than the supposedly *fastest* skiplist library in Go, with lookups at around the same speed.

You can test it with ~go test -bench='Add' -run=^a -benchtime=19999999x~
